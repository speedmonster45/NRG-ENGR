In my pursuit if trying to maintain balance i of course have the one disease that threatens to throw off time itself from my mind.
often times i find myself really not considering the time cost of things
the anxiety of not realizing everything that i could be doing, 
sometimes i spend too much time in my head
it really causes me to be flustered when deep in thought
scatterbrained
pursuiant of animalistic tendencies. 
i cantb blame all of this on my brain developing differently than others
i have the choice to push myself forward more and more. 
i often ask myself are the choices i make through the lense of wickedness or weakness
moento mori will always make me more motivated but i do need help from my medication
