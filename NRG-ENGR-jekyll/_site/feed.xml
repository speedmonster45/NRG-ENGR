often times i find myself really not considering the time cost of things
the anxiety of not realizing everything that i could be doing, 
sometimes i spend too much time in my head
it really causes me to be flustered when deep in thought
scatterbrained
pursuiant of animalistic tendencies. 
i cantb blame all of this on my brain developing differently than others
i have the choice to push myself forward more and more. 
i often ask myself are the choices i make through the lense of wickedness or weakness
moento mori will always make me more motivated but i do need help from my medication</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my pursuit if trying to maintain balance i of course have the one disease that threatens to throw off time itself from my mind. often times i find myself really not considering the time cost of things the anxiety of not realizing everything that i could be doing, sometimes i spend too much time in my head it really causes me to be flustered when deep in thought scatterbrained pursuiant of animalistic tendencies. i cantb blame all of this on my brain developing differently than others i have the choice to push myself forward more and more. i often ask myself are the choices i make through the lense of wickedness or weakness moento mori will always make me more motivated but i do need help from my medication]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">the UX design journey</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/08/27/ux-designs.MARKUP" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="the UX design journey" /><published>2024-08-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-08-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/08/27/ux-designs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/08/27/ux-designs.MARKUP"><![CDATA[#UX-Design
